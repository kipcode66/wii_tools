# nandpack

This is a script to manipulate wii save files. It has a focus on allowing to patch Twilight Princess save files to inject custom code in the game, but it can be used to do various generic stuff to any wii save file.

You can find the user manual by running the script without any argument:

    $ ./nandpack.py
